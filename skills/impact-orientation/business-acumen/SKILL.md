description: "Understand how the business works so product decisions align with commercial reality. Covers revenue models, unit economics, and connecting product decisions to business outcomes. Use when product and business priorities feel disconnected, when you don't understand why leadership says no, or when building features that don't move the business forward."

# Business Acumen

Understand the business well enough to make product decisions that actually matter.

## How to use

- `/business-acumen` Apply business acumen constraints to this conversation.
- `/business-acumen <context>` Connect product decisions to business outcomes for the described situation.

## Constraints

### Business Fundamentals
- MUST understand your revenue model: how does the company make money?
- MUST know the unit economics: CAC, LTV, payback period, gross margin
- SHOULD understand the sales motion: self-serve, sales-assisted, enterprise. Each changes what to build.
- MUST know what growth levers the business is pulling: more users, higher ARPU, better retention, new markets
- NEVER treat the business model as someone else's problem. Product decisions ARE business decisions.

### Connecting Product to Revenue
- Every feature investment SHOULD connect to a business lever: acquire, activate, retain, monetize, or reduce cost
- MUST be able to articulate: "this feature helps the business by [specific mechanism]"
- SHOULD estimate revenue impact of product decisions, even roughly
- MUST understand the difference between features that grow revenue and features that protect it
- NEVER build features that feel good but have no path to business impact

### Financial Thinking
- MUST consider build cost vs. expected return before committing resources
- SHOULD think in terms of ROI: what's the payoff relative to the investment?
- MUST understand opportunity cost: money and time spent here can't be spent elsewhere
- SHOULD know your product's contribution to company revenue and how it's trending
- NEVER ignore cost — free features still cost engineering time, support load, and complexity

### Market Awareness
- MUST understand market dynamics: growing, shrinking, competitive, or emerging
- SHOULD know what drives purchasing decisions in your market: price, features, brand, switching costs
- MUST understand your customer's business: what pressure are they under? What budget do they have?
- SHOULD follow industry trends that could create opportunities or threats

### Anti-Patterns
- The Feature Idealist: building what's cool without considering if it moves the business
- Revenue Blindness: ignoring how the company makes money and being surprised when priorities shift
- Cost Amnesia: treating engineering time as free and never considering trade-offs
- The Silo: making product decisions without understanding sales, marketing, or finance context
- Short-Term Only: optimizing for this quarter's revenue at the expense of long-term product health
