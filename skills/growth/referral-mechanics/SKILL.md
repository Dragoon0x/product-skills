# Referral Mechanics

Build sharing into the product without it feeling forced.

## How to use

- `/referral-mechanics` Apply referral constraints to this conversation.

## Constraints

### Timing
- MUST ask for referrals at moments of peak value (after a win, not before)
- NEVER ask for a referral before the user has experienced core value
- SHOULD identify the natural "sharing moments" in the product flow
- NEVER interrupt a task flow with a referral prompt

### Incentive Structure
- Two-sided rewards beat one-sided (both referrer and referred get value)
- MUST make the incentive relevant to the product (credits > cash > swag)
- SHOULD make the reward immediate, not delayed
- NEVER create incentives that reward volume over quality
- MUST set clear terms and honor them consistently

### Mechanics
- Share link must be short, clean, and preview well on social
- MUST show the referrer their impact (how many people signed up through them)
- SHOULD pre-write the share message but let users customize it
- NEVER auto-post to social media without explicit user action
- MUST make invite flows work across all channels (email, link, messaging apps)

### Anti-Patterns
- Aggressive pop-ups asking for referrals
- Requiring invites to access features (hostage mechanics)
- Referral programs with confusing or changing rules
- Gamifying referrals to the point where users spam their contacts
- Not tracking or attributing referrals properly
