# Competitive Positioning

Understand where you sit in the market and make sure customers understand it too.

## How to use

- `/competitive-positioning` Apply competitive positioning constraints to this conversation.
- `/competitive-positioning <market>` Analyze positioning for the described competitive landscape.

## Constraints

### Competitive Landscape
- MUST map competitors by what they actually compete on, not by feature lists
- SHOULD categorize: direct competitors (same problem, same approach), indirect competitors (same problem, different approach), and alternatives (including doing nothing)
- MUST understand why customers choose each competitor — talk to churned users and lost deals
- NEVER dismiss a competitor without understanding why their customers stay

### Differentiation
- MUST choose a differentiation axis you can win on and defend
- Differentiation MUST matter to the customer, not just look good in a pitch deck
- SHOULD differentiate on the dimension your target segment cares most about
- NEVER try to win on every axis. Being best at one thing beats being decent at everything.
- MUST be honest about where competitors are stronger. Credibility comes from honesty.

### Category Strategy
- MUST decide: are you entering an existing category or creating a new one?
- Entering: define your differentiation sharply. Why pick you over the incumbent?
- Creating: name the category in plain language. Educate the market on why this category matters.
- NEVER define your category by what you're not. Define it by what you enable.

### Competitive Response
- MUST have a clear response for when competitors ship something you don't have
- SHOULD distinguish between features that matter to your segment and features that don't
- NEVER chase competitor features reactively without validating customer demand
- MUST update competitive positioning when the landscape changes materially

### Anti-Patterns
- Feature Comparison Obsession: competing on checkbox features instead of value delivered
- Competitor Worship: defining your roadmap by what competitors build
- Ignoring Indirect Competition: the spreadsheet and the intern are your real competitors
- Category Jargon: creating a category name that only you understand
- The Arms Race: matching every competitor feature and losing focus in the process
