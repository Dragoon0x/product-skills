# Competitive Framing

Position against alternatives without being negative.

## How to use

- `/competitive-framing` Apply competitive framing constraints to this conversation.
- `/competitive-framing <product>` Generate a competitive frame for the described product.

## Constraints

### Landscape Mapping
- MUST identify the real alternatives (including "do nothing" and manual workarounds)
- MUST map alternatives on 2-3 axes that matter to the target user
- NEVER define axes where you win on every dimension. That's not framing, that's fantasy.
- SHOULD acknowledge where alternatives are genuinely strong

### Framing Rules
- Frame the shift, not the competitor. "Spreadsheets vs. purpose-built tools" not "Us vs. Excel"
- MUST lead with what you enable, not what others lack
- NEVER use negative language about competitors by name
- SHOULD use "before/after" framing over "us/them" framing
- MUST ground every comparison in observable, verifiable differences

### Comparison Pages
- MUST be factually accurate. Verify every claim.
- SHOULD include dates for competitor feature checks (features change)
- MUST disclose if comparison data comes from public sources vs. direct testing
- NEVER cherry-pick metrics where you win while hiding areas where you don't
- SHOULD include a "best for" recommendation for each alternative, including honest cases where the competitor is the better choice

### Anti-Patterns
- FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) tactics
- Comparing your roadmap to their current product
- Using outdated competitor information
- Making the comparison page the landing page (establish value first)
- Positioning against a competitor that your users have never heard of
