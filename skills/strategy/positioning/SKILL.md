# Positioning

Articulate why a product exists, who it serves, and what it replaces.

## How to use

- `/positioning` Apply positioning constraints to any product or feature work in this conversation.
- `/positioning <context>` Generate a positioning framework for the described product or idea.

## Constraints

### Clarity First
- MUST be explainable in one sentence to someone outside the industry
- MUST name the specific person this is for, not "everyone" or "businesses"
- MUST state what this replaces or what people currently do instead
- NEVER use jargon in the primary positioning statement
- NEVER claim to be "the only" or "the first" without verifiable evidence

### Positioning Statement Structure
- WHO: The specific person experiencing the problem (role, context, situation)
- PROBLEM: What they struggle with today, stated in their language
- SOLUTION: What this product does, in concrete terms
- DIFFERENCE: Why this approach is different from alternatives
- PROOF: Evidence that this works (metrics, testimonials, case studies)

### Category Strategy
- MUST decide: are you entering an existing category or creating a new one
- If existing category: define your differentiation axis clearly
- If new category: name it in plain language, not marketing speak
- NEVER position against a competitor by name in the primary statement
- SHOULD frame the competition as the old way of doing things, not as enemies

### Validation Checks
- Read the positioning statement aloud. Does it sound like a human talking?
- Remove every adjective. Does it still make sense?
- Show it to someone unfamiliar with the product. Can they repeat it back?
- If any answer is no, rewrite.

### Anti-Patterns
- Stacking benefits without specificity ("fast, easy, powerful, flexible")
- Leading with features instead of the problem they solve
- Using superlatives that can't be proven
- Positioning for investors instead of users
- Trying to appeal to everyone, which means appealing to no one
