# Competitive Battlecard

Create tactical guides for positioning against specific competitors in real conversations.

## How to use

- `/competitive-battlecard` Apply battlecard constraints to this conversation.
- `/competitive-battlecard <competitor>` Generate a battlecard against the named competitor.

## Constraints

### Competitor Snapshot
- MUST describe what they do in one sentence. If you can't, you don't understand them.
- MUST name their ideal customer profile
- MUST state their pricing model and rough range
- MUST state their claimed positioning — what they say they're best at
- SHOULD note funding stage or company size as a behavioral signal

### Where We Win
- List 3-5 specific advantages. Not "better UX" — measurable, demonstrable differences.
- Each advantage MUST have: the advantage, a proof point, and the actual words to use in conversation
- NEVER claim advantages you can't demonstrate or prove

### Where We Lose
- MUST be honest. Every product loses somewhere.
- Each weakness MUST include: what the competitor does better, which customers care, and how to handle it honestly
- NEVER dodge weaknesses. Acknowledge and redirect.
- SHOULD frame as trade-offs, not failures

### Objection Handling
- List top 5 things prospects say about the competitor in deals
- For each: what they say, what they actually mean, and how to respond
- NEVER badmouth the competitor directly. Position against the approach, not the company.
- SHOULD reframe objections as opportunities to highlight your strengths

### Competitive Landmines
- Questions to ask early in the sales process that highlight your strengths
- MUST be honest questions, not manipulative tricks
- Examples: "Ask them to demo onboarding end-to-end" or "Ask about pricing at 500 users"

### When to Walk Away
- MUST define signals that mean the prospect is a better fit for the competitor
- Walking away gracefully builds long-term reputation
- NEVER fight for a deal where the customer will churn in 6 months

### Maintenance
- Battlecards go stale fast. Update when: competitor ships major changes, you lose 3+ deals for the same reason, or quarterly regardless
