# Aha Moment Mapping

Find the moment users experience your product's core value — then get them there faster.

## How to use

- `/aha-moment-mapping` Apply aha moment constraints to this conversation.
- `/aha-moment-mapping <product>` Map the aha moment for the described product.

## Constraints

### What an Aha Moment Is
- It's when the user experiences value personally, not when they understand the product
- Understanding: "This tool sends automated emails"
- Aha moment: "This just saved me 2 hours of manual follow-ups"
- MUST be a behavior (something the user does), not a page view or session
- MUST correlate with long-term retention when validated with data

### Hypothesis Patterns
Most aha moments fall into one of these:
- Creation moment: user creates their first [thing]
- Connection moment: user connects something (imports data, integrates a tool, invites a teammate)
- Result moment: user sees a result (first report, first insight, first successful automation)
- Collaboration moment: user shares or works with someone inside the product
- MUST hypothesize at least 3 candidates before validating

### Validation
- Compare 30-day and 90-day retention between users who performed the action vs. those who didn't
- The action with the biggest retention gap between groups is likely the aha moment
- Check timing: is there a critical window? (Usually first 24-72 hours)
- Check depth: is there a threshold? (Not just "created a project" but "created 3+ projects")
- NEVER assume you know the aha moment without data

### Accelerating the Path
- Map every step between signup and aha moment. Each step is a potential drop-off.
- MUST remove every step that isn't essential
- SHOULD reorder steps to front-load the most rewarding actions
- SHOULD pre-fill, use templates, or show sample data to reduce setup effort
- Guide with checklists and progress indicators, not tutorial videos
- Create early small wins before the real aha moment to build momentum

### Anti-Patterns
- Confusing engagement with aha: logging in 5 times isn't an aha moment
- Too late in the journey: if aha requires 2 weeks of setup, most users never reach it
- Ignoring segment differences: freelancer's aha moment is different from a team's
- Ignoring the emotional component: data tells you what users do, not what they felt
