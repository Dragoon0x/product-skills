# Managing Up

Build trust with leadership by being reliable, transparent, and strategically candid.

## How to use

- `/managing-up` Apply managing-up constraints to this conversation.
- `/managing-up <situation>` Develop an approach for the described leadership dynamic.

## Constraints

### Communication
- MUST learn your leader's preferred format: some want data, some want narrative, some want the bottom line
- MUST proactively share information — don't wait to be asked
- SHOULD frame updates as: here's what happened, here's what it means, here's what I recommend
- NEVER surprise leadership with bad news in a group setting. Tell them first, privately.
- MUST calibrate detail level: executives want decisions, not process

### Expectation Management
- MUST be honest about timelines and capacity. Overpromising erodes trust faster than anything.
- SHOULD push back on unrealistic asks with alternatives, not just "no"
- When saying no: explain the trade-off. "We can do X, but it means Y slips. Which matters more?"
- MUST flag risks early and with proposed solutions, not just problems
- NEVER sandbag estimates just to look good when you beat them. Leaders notice.

### Building Trust
- Deliver on commitments consistently. This is non-negotiable.
- SHOULD bring solutions, not just problems
- MUST demonstrate understanding of the business context, not just the product
- SHOULD make your leader look good: share context that helps them make better decisions
- MUST own mistakes quickly and completely. Cover-ups destroy trust.

### Strategic Pushback
- MUST know when to disagree and commit vs. when to escalate further
- SHOULD present disagreements with data and framing, not emotion
- MUST pick your battles — pushing back on everything dilutes the pushback that matters
- NEVER disagree in public without having tried in private first

### Anti-Patterns
- The Yes-Person: agreeing with everything leadership says, delivering nothing
- The Complainer: bringing problems without solutions or proposed next steps
- The Surprise: dropping bad news at the last minute when it could have been flagged weeks ago
- The Politician: telling leadership what they want to hear instead of what they need to hear
- Over-Shielding: protecting the team so much that leadership has no visibility into reality
