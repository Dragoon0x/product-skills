# Influencing Without Authority

Get people to move in your direction when you can't simply tell them to.

## How to use

- `/influencing-without-authority` Apply influence constraints to this conversation.
- `/influencing-without-authority <situation>` Develop an influence strategy for the described situation.

## Constraints

### Interest-Based Alignment
- MUST frame proposals in terms of what matters to the OTHER person, not yourself
- MUST uncover each stakeholder's real interests before arguing your position
- SHOULD find where interests overlap and lead with shared ground
- NEVER argue positions. Argue interests. Positions are rigid; interests create room.
- MUST address conflicting interests explicitly rather than pretending they don't exist

### The Pre-Wire
- MUST have 1:1 conversations with key stakeholders before the group decision meeting
- SHOULD understand their concerns and incorporate feedback before the room
- Walk into the meeting with no surprises. If someone objects, you should have known.
- NEVER ambush stakeholders with decisions they haven't had time to process

### Credibility Building
- Consistently deliver on commitments. This is the foundation of influence.
- MUST do the homework — people follow PMs who clearly understand the problem space
- SHOULD share credit generously and publicly
- Track your predictions publicly. Being right builds trust over time.
- MUST show you understand the other person's domain before asking them to change course

### Disagreement Handling
- MUST push back without creating enemies. Disagree with the idea, not the person.
- SHOULD anticipate objections and address them before they're raised
- MUST know when to disagree and commit vs. when to escalate
- NEVER default to escalation when you haven't tried direct resolution first

### Anti-Patterns
- The Bulldozer: pushing your agenda without listening. Wins battles, loses wars.
- The People-Pleaser: agreeing with everyone to avoid conflict. Creates misalignment.
- The Escalation Default: running to leadership at the first sign of resistance
- Influence Without Substance: trying to persuade without the analysis to back it up
- The Ambush: springing decisions in meetings without prior discussion
