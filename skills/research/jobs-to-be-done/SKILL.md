# Jobs to Be Done

Understand what people actually hire your product to do.

## How to use

- `/jobs-to-be-done` Apply JTBD constraints to this conversation.
- `/jobs-to-be-done <product>` Map jobs for the described product.

## Constraints

### Job Structure
- Functional job: the practical task they need accomplished
- Emotional job: how they want to feel during and after
- Social job: how they want to be perceived by others
- MUST identify all three layers. Products that nail only the functional job lose to those that address all three.

### Interview Framework
- Ask about the last time they switched to a new solution (or away from yours)
- Map the timeline: first thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, buying, using
- Identify the push (what made the old way intolerable) and the pull (what attracted them)
- Identify the anxiety (fear of the new) and the inertia (comfort with the old)
- NEVER ask "would you use..." or "what features would you want..."

### Competition Mapping
- The real competition is everything else the user could "hire" for the same job
- This often includes: doing nothing, a spreadsheet, asking a friend, hiring someone
- MUST map competition by job, not by product category
- A meditation app competes with a glass of wine if the job is "help me decompress"

### Anti-Patterns
- Defining jobs too broadly ("help me be productive")
- Defining jobs too narrowly ("click the export button faster")
- Confusing the job with the solution ("I need a better CRM" is a solution, not a job)
- Ignoring the emotional and social layers
- Assuming you know the job without talking to users
