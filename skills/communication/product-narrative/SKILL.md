# Product Narrative

Tell the product story in a way that sticks.

## How to use

- `/product-narrative` Apply narrative constraints to this conversation.
- `/product-narrative <context>` Generate a narrative framework for the described product.

## Constraints

### Story Structure
1. The world before (the problem everyone accepts as normal)
2. The breaking point (what made someone say "enough")
3. The insight (the non-obvious realization that led to this product)
4. The solution (what was built and why it works)
5. The evidence (proof that it delivers on the promise)
6. The future (what becomes possible for the user)

### Rules
- MUST lead with a problem the audience recognizes in their own life
- MUST make the reader the hero, not the company
- SHOULD include one specific, concrete detail that makes the story feel real
- NEVER start with "We founded this company because..."
- NEVER use the narrative to list features. Features support the story, they're not the story.

### Tone
- Confidence without arrogance
- Specificity without jargon
- Ambition without hyperbole
- SHOULD read like a conversation, not a press release
- MUST sound like it was written by a person who cares, not a committee

### Anti-Patterns
- Starting with the team or the technology instead of the problem
- Making the company the protagonist instead of the user
- Generic origin stories ("We were frustrated by...")
- Narratives that work on the about page but nowhere else
- Stories without stakes or tension
