# Conversion Copy

Write headlines, CTAs, and value props that move people to act.

## How to use

- `/conversion-copy` Apply copy constraints to this conversation.
- `/conversion-copy audit` Audit existing copy against these constraints.

## Constraints

### Headlines
- MUST communicate the core benefit in 6-12 words
- MUST use specific language over abstract language ("Save 4 hours/week" not "Save time")
- SHOULD start with what the user gets, not what the product does
- NEVER use jargon the target user wouldn't use in conversation
- Test: would this make sense on a billboard at 60mph?

### Value Propositions
- MUST answer "so what?" for every claim
- MUST include at least one specific number, timeframe, or outcome
- SHOULD use the user's language, not product language
- NEVER stack adjectives without evidence ("fast, easy, powerful")
- Formula: [Who] can [outcome] by [mechanism] in [timeframe]

### Audit Checklist
- Remove every adjective. Does the copy still communicate value?
- Replace every "we" with "you". Does it still work?
- Read it aloud. Does it sound like a human talking?
- Show it to someone unfamiliar. Can they explain what this product does?
- If any answer is no, rewrite.

### Anti-Patterns
- Starting with the company name or "Welcome to"
- Using "solution" as a noun (what problem? for whom?)
- Passive voice in CTAs ("Your account will be created" vs "Create your account")
- Copy that describes what the product is instead of what it does for the user
- Marketing superlatives without proof ("Best-in-class", "World's leading")
