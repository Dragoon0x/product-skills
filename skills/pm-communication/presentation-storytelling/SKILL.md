# Presentation & Storytelling

Structure presentations that persuade through narrative, not bullet points.

## How to use

- `/presentation-storytelling` Apply presentation constraints to this conversation.
- `/presentation-storytelling <topic>` Structure a presentation for the described topic.

## Constraints

### Narrative Structure
- MUST follow a story arc: situation (where we are), complication (the problem), resolution (what to do)
- MUST open with something the audience cares about, not background they already know
- SHOULD build to a clear ask or decision point
- NEVER start with the agenda slide. Start with why this matters.
- MUST end with what happens next — every presentation should drive action

### Audience Calibration
- MUST know the audience before structuring content: what do they already know, what do they care about, what can they do?
- Executives: lead with the recommendation, then support it. Don't build up to it.
- Peers: lead with context and bring them along the reasoning
- NEVER present the same way to every audience. Tailor depth and framing.

### Slide Discipline
- One idea per slide. If a slide makes two points, split it.
- MUST use the slide title as the headline — the title should state the takeaway, not the topic
- "Revenue grew 40% YoY" beats "Revenue Update" as a slide title
- SHOULD limit to 10-15 slides for a 30-minute presentation
- NEVER read slides aloud. Slides support the story, they don't tell it.

### Data Presentation
- MUST lead with the insight, then show the data that supports it
- SHOULD use one chart per slide with a clear annotation of the takeaway
- NEVER show a chart without explaining what the audience should see in it
- MUST label axes, include time ranges, and provide context for numbers

### Anti-Patterns
- The Data Dump: 40 slides of charts with no narrative thread
- The Slow Build: 10 slides of background before getting to the point
- The Democratic Deck: trying to address every stakeholder's concern on every slide
- Font-Size Anxiety: cramming text until it's unreadable because "it's all important"
- No Ask: presenting information without a clear decision or action needed
