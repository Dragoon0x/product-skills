# Trust Signals

Build credibility through evidence, not claims.

## How to use

- `/trust-signals` Apply trust signal constraints to this conversation.

## Constraints

### Hierarchy of Trust (strongest to weakest)
1. Specific metrics from named customers ("Saved 14 hours/week" - Sarah, VP at Acme)
2. Named customer logos from recognizable companies
3. Aggregate numbers ("Used by 2,400 teams")
4. Star ratings with review count
5. Security/compliance badges
6. General testimonial quotes without specifics

### Placement Rules
- MUST place first trust signal within 1 scroll of the hero
- MUST place trust signals near every major CTA
- SHOULD increase trust signal density as the page approaches the conversion point
- NEVER cluster all social proof in one section. Distribute it.
- NEVER show an empty testimonial section or "as seen in" with no logos

### Quality Rules
- Testimonials MUST include: name, role, company, and a specific outcome
- NEVER use stock photos for testimonial avatars
- Logos MUST be real customers. Remove any that are aspirational.
- Case study structure: situation, problem, solution, measurable result
- Numbers MUST be current and verifiable. Round down, not up.

### Anti-Patterns
- Fake urgency counters ("Only 3 spots left!")
- Testimonials that sound written by marketing
- Trust badges from organizations nobody recognizes
- "As featured in" with publications that feature everyone
- Social proof without specificity ("Great product!" - John)
