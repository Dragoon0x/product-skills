# CTA Patterns

Design calls-to-action that people actually click.

## How to use

- `/cta-patterns` Apply CTA constraints to this conversation.

## Constraints

### Copy Rules
- MUST start with a verb ("Start", "Get", "Try", "See", "Create")
- MUST tell the user what happens next, not what they're committing to
- "Start free trial" beats "Sign up". "See pricing" beats "Learn more".
- NEVER use "Submit", "Click here", or "Learn more" as primary CTA text
- SHOULD include a benefit: "Get started free" not just "Get started"
- Secondary CTA should be a text link, not a competing button

### Placement
- MUST be visible without scrolling on the primary landing surface
- MUST repeat after every major content section that builds intent
- MUST be the highest-contrast element in its container
- NEVER place two primary CTAs with different actions in the same viewport
- SHOULD add a low-commitment alternative near high-commitment CTAs

### Progressive Commitment
- First CTA: lowest friction possible (no credit card, no forms)
- In-product: escalate commitment as the user experiences value
- NEVER ask for payment before the user has experienced the core value
- SHOULD show what the user gets before showing what it costs

### Anti-Patterns
- Ghost buttons for primary CTAs (low contrast = low clicks)
- CTAs that navigate away without explaining the destination
- Identical CTA text across different page sections
- Pop-up CTAs that interrupt before the user has engaged
- Disabling the CTA while "loading" with no feedback
