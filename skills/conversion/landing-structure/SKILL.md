# Landing Structure

Information architecture that guides visitors from curiosity to commitment.

## How to use

- `/landing-structure` Apply these constraints to landing page work in this conversation.

## Constraints

### Section Order (high-intent traffic)
1. Hero: Problem + solution in one screen. CTA visible without scrolling.
2. Social proof: logos, numbers, or one strong testimonial.
3. How it works: 3 steps max. Show, don't tell.
4. Features/benefits: lead with outcomes, support with features.
5. Deeper social proof: case studies, detailed testimonials.
6. Pricing or next step.
7. FAQ: handle remaining objections.
8. Final CTA: repeat the primary action.

### Section Order (low-intent traffic)
1. Hero: Lead with the problem. Make them feel understood.
2. Problem amplification: show the cost of the status quo.
3. Solution introduction.
4. How it works: simple, visual, concrete.
5. Social proof: trust before asking for commitment.
6. Low-commitment CTA: free trial, demo, newsletter.

### Rules
- MUST have exactly one primary CTA per page (repeated, not different)
- MUST make the hero scannable in under 5 seconds
- MUST answer "what is this, who is it for, why should I care" before first scroll
- Hero headline: 6-12 words. Subheadline: 15-25 words
- NEVER start with "Welcome to..." or the company name
- NEVER bury CTA below 3+ scrolls
- NEVER have two consecutive text-heavy sections without visual break
