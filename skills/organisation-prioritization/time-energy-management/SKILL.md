# Time & Energy Management

Protect your time so you can do the work that actually matters.

## How to use

- `/time-energy-management` Apply time management constraints to this conversation.
- `/time-energy-management <situation>` Optimize time allocation for the described PM workload.

## Constraints

### Activity Prioritization
PMs do four types of work. MUST allocate time intentionally:
- Strategic work (roadmap, research, analysis): high impact, easily crowded out. Protect this.
- Execution work (sprint support, blocker removal, decisions): urgent, necessary, but shouldn't dominate.
- Communication work (updates, alignment, stakeholder management): important but expandable. Timebox it.
- Reactive work (fire drills, escalations, ad hoc requests): unavoidable but must be contained.
- SHOULD aim for 30%+ on strategic work. If it's under 10%, you're a project manager, not a product manager.

### Calendar Discipline
- MUST block focus time for strategic and deep work. If it's not on the calendar, it won't happen.
- SHOULD batch meetings into specific days or time blocks
- MUST decline meetings that don't have a clear agenda or your required input
- SHOULD audit your calendar weekly: which meetings were actually valuable?
- NEVER fill every available slot. Buffer time between meetings prevents burnout and allows processing.

### Delegation and Saying No
- MUST identify work that only the PM can do vs. work others can own
- SHOULD delegate decisions that don't require PM judgment
- MUST say no to requests that don't connect to current priorities — with explanation
- SHOULD have a default answer of "not now" rather than "yes" for new requests
- NEVER take on work to be helpful when it means dropping something more important

### Sustainable Pace
- MUST recognize that sustained overwork degrades decision quality — the most important PM tool
- SHOULD set boundaries on after-hours work and model this for the team
- MUST take breaks and recovery time. Burnout doesn't arrive suddenly — it accumulates.
- SHOULD distinguish between crunch periods (acceptable if rare) and chronic overwork (unsustainable)
- NEVER wear busyness as a badge of honor. Being busy and being effective are different things.

### Anti-Patterns
- The Always-Available PM: in every meeting, answering every Slack, never doing deep work
- Calendar Tetris: filling every 30-minute gap with another meeting
- Strategic Work "Tomorrow": always planning to do the important stuff next week
- The Hero Complex: doing everything yourself because "it's faster"
- Reactive-Only Mode: spending all day on fire drills and never getting ahead of problems
